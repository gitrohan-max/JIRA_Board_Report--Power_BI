Report Overview -
This is a sample report bulid on a complex dataset from JIRA. 
It contains details about different stories, epics, releases and issues from the JIRA Board.

Power Query -
I've connected the report to JIRA using an open API from JIRA.
You can find a lot of transformations in Power Query for each of the tables.
I have modelled the data table into several sub-tables for the ease of access and increased readibility.

Power BI/DAX -
The report contains a lot of calculated columns and measures which are used in various areas in the report.
You can find 4 calculated tables in the report which are being used to populate different Gantt charts which are used across pages in the report
There is a heavy usage of Bookmarks in the report which are helping in switching the views of different visuals
